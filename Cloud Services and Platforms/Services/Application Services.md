**1. What are application services in the cloud, and how do they simplify the deployment and management of applications?**  

Application services in the cloud are managed platforms that provide the tools and infrastructure developers need to build, deploy, and manage applications without handling the underlying hardware or complex configurations. They simplify the process by offering:

- **Automated provisioning**: Developers can deploy applications quickly without setting up servers.
- **Built-in scalability**: Applications automatically scale based on demand.
- **Preconfigured environments**: They provide ready-to-use runtime environments like Node.js, Python, or Java, reducing setup time.
- **Monitoring and maintenance**: These services include built-in monitoring, logging, and patch management, freeing developers from infrastructure upkeep.  
    Examples include **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **Google App Engine**, and **Azure App Services**.

**2. What are the benefits of using cloud platforms for application hosting over traditional methods?**  

Using cloud platforms for application hosting offers several advantages over traditional on-premises hosting:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing eliminates upfront hardware costs.
- **Scalability**: Applications can scale up or down instantly based on user demand.
- **Global Availability**: Applications can be deployed to multiple geographic regions for improved performance and reliability.
- **Reduced Maintenance**: The cloud provider manages updates, patches, and hardware failures.
- **Integrated Tools**: Cloud platforms offer analytics, security, and monitoring tools, reducing development overhead.
- **Faster Deployment**: Developers can deploy applications faster with preconfigured environments and automation.
