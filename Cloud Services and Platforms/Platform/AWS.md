#### 1. **What is an AWS region, and why is it important in cloud computing?**  
An AWS region is a geographically isolated area where AWS data centers are located. Each region consists of multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance. Regions are important because they enable low-latency access, compliance with local regulations, and disaster recovery through data replication across zones.

#### 2. **How do AWS regions enhance global availability and fault tolerance?**

AWS regions enhance global availability by distributing services across multiple geographically separated locations. Each region has multiple AZs, which are physically isolated but interconnected. This design allows applications to remain operational even if one AZ fails, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

#### 3.**What factors should be considered when selecting an AWS region for deploying cloud services?**

Key factors include:

- **Latency:** Choose regions closer to end-users for lower latency.
- **Service Availability:** Verify if specific AWS services are supported in the selected region.
- **Cost:** Different regions have varying pricing structures. Choose wisely to reduce costs.

#### 4. **What are AWS Availability Zones, and how do they differ from regions?**

AWS Availability Zones (AZs) are isolated data centers within an AWS region. Each AZ consists of one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. Regions are geographic locations containing multiple AZs. While a region provides a broad geographic boundary, AZs within a region ensure data redundancy, fault tolerance, and low-latency communication.

#### 5. **Explain the role of Availability Zones in ensuring high availability and disaster recovery.**

AZs play a crucial role in ensuring high availability by enabling redundancy and failover. Services deployed across multiple AZs can automatically shift traffic to healthy instances if one AZ goes down. For disaster recovery, AZs support data replication and backups, ensuring minimal data loss and reduced recovery times during failures. Services like Amazon S3, RDS, and DynamoDB, replicate data across multiple AZs and it is entirely automatic, managed, and occurs in real time or near-real time.

#### 6.  **What is an Amazon VPC, and what purpose does it serve?**

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a secure, customizable network. It enables control over network configurations and security settings. All new customers have a default VPC
